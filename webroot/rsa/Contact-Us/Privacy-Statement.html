This privacy statement describes how we go about collecting and managing your personal information in a confidential manner.
Our procedures for protecting your personal information do not in any way diminish our obligation of confidentiality to you, or any of our other clients, nor do these procedures take away any legal professional privilege to which you or our other customers may be entitled.</p><p><strong>Collecting and Using Information</strong></p><p>WE collect two types of information. The first type is anonymous information. For example, we may collect information to tell us how many people accessed this Privacy Policy on a particular day, but we do not know their personal information (i.e. we do not know their names, addresses, where they live or their place of birth as they are ‘anonymous’ to us). WE only uses anonymous information in the aggregate. This collective data allows us determine audience usage of our sites, so we can improve our services. We may publish this anonymous aggregate data, or provide it to other people.</p><p>The second type of information WE collect is personal information. Personal information is collected by our staff in the course of providing customers with our products and services. Most personal information is provided directly by the owner of that information for a specific purpose.</p><p>We do not collect information about your sexual preference, race and/or religion, unless you have consented to provide the same or where we are permitted or required by law to do so.</p><p>We use the personal information only for the designated specific purpose for which it was collected (and purposes to which you have consented).</p><p>Examples of situations in which we collect personal information include when you request to be placed on a mailing list or ask about our products or services.</p><p>In addition, WE may use your personal information for related secondary purposes. Examples of secondary purposes for which we use personal information include where we conduct a credit check or where we send you bulletins or information about other products and services that we provide.</p><p>With each customer we may collect personal information and financial information so that we can collect payment for the products and services we deliver. Customers may also be the subject of a credit check conducted by a credit agency to protect our ability to recover our consulting and licensing fees.</p><p>We also collect personal information from job applicants.</p><p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p><p>There will be some occasions where it will be necessary for WE to disclose your personal information to third parties. WE may be required by law to disclose your personal information, or WE may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties to provide the service, including WE Services, you have requested (although this disclosure will only be made where it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which you disclosed your personal information).</p><p>Under the Data Provision Requirements 2012, 5 Star Online Training is required to collect personal information about you and to disclose that personal information to the National Centre for Vocational Education Research Ltd (NCVER).</p><p>Your personal information (including the personal information contained on this enrolment form), may be used or disclosed by 5 Star Online Training for statistical, administrative, regulatory and research purposes. 5 Star Online Training may disclose your personal information for these purposes to:</p><p>Commonwealth and State or Territory government departments and authorised agencies; and
NCVER.
Personal information that has been disclosed to NCVER may be used or disclosed by NCVER for the following purposes:</p><p>populating authenticated VET transcripts;
facilitating statistics and research relating to education, including surveys and data linkage;
pre-populating RTO student enrolment forms;
understanding how the VET market operates, for policy, workforce planning and consumer information; and
administering VET, including program administration, regulation, monitoring and evaluation.
You may receive a student survey which may be administered by a government department or NCVER employee, agent or third party contractor or other authorised agencies. Please note you may opt out of the survey at the time of being contacted.</p><p>NCVER will collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), the National VET Data Policy and all NCVER policies and protocols (including those published on NCVER&rsquo;s website at <a href=https://www.ncver.edu.au>www.ncver.edu.au</a>).</p><p><strong>Cookies</strong></p><p>Where we use “cookies” technology on our website, it is done to allow us to identify your movements around our site, which provides us with needed information for improving our service to customers. We do not use cookies to determine the identity of individual users.</p><p><strong>Securing Information</strong></p><p>We take all reasonable steps to ensure your personal information remains secure. Our staff are bound by confidentiality undertakings to you that support this privacy statement. Our databases, that house your personal information, have in place the necessary access restrictions to limit control and access to permitted personnel of WE.</p><p>We keep your personal information for the time period necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected and for permitted secondary purposes.</p><p><strong>Your Access to Information</strong></p><p>We will provide you with access to your personal information that we have on file upon your request. Please provide us with as much detail as you can about the particular information to which you seek access, in order to have us meet your request. An access fee may be charged to cover our costs of providing the information to you.</p><p><strong>No sale of personal information</strong></p><p>Under no circumstances will WE sell or receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information.</p><p><strong>Interacting with the Software</strong></p><p>There are interactive features on the Software to which you may contribute. As a condition of interacting with the Software, you consent to use your discretion and exercise caution when providing your personal information and act as the average reasonable professional person would act in the same or similar circumstances.</p><p>Note that whenever you post personal information in publicly accessible places, this information becomes available to anyone with access to the internet. This information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Therefore, we recommend that you refrain from posting any information that you do not want seen in these public areas.</p><p>Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any personal information. Be responsible whenever you are online.</p><p><strong>Questions or Feedback</strong></p><p>If you have any questions or comments about privacy, or wish to make a complaint about the way in which we have handled your personal information, you may contact us at:</p><p>Email: <a href=mailto:privacy@onlinersa.com.au>privacy@onlinersa.com.au</a>
