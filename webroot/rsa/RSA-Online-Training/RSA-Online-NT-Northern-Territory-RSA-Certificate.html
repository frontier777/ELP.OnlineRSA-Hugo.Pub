How old do you have to be to get an RSA?</summary><p>There is no practical age limit on getting your RSA, but, as an minor under the age of 18, you will not be permitted to sell or serve alcohol anywhere in Australia, ie. even with an RSA.</p><p>That said, it is not unusual for minors to obtain an RSA and there are several benefits;</p><ul><li>Gain a good understanding of the effects of alcohol on the body.</li><li>Better aware of the environment you may be working in as a waiter or in food prep.</li><li>Able to collect used glasses from tables as a RSA is required for that task.</li><li>Are overall less risky to the business - some venues require all staff to be certified.</li><li>Can begin serving alcohol on the day you turn 18.</li></ul></details><details><summary>2. How long do RSA statement of attainments last for?</summary><p>It depends on the State and the RSA certificate.</p><p>The national unit of competency Provide Responsible Service of Alcohol SITHFAB021 statement of attainment itself, never expires.</p><p>But, certain States such as ACT require your training to be refreshed every 3 years and the NSW RSA competency card has a 5 year expiry.</p><p>In general most States recommend that if you have been out of the industry for over 3 years, then you should refresh your RSA skills. This full RSA course is perfectly acceptable to use as a RSA refresher course.</p></details><details><summary>3. Can I get my RSA today, same-day?</summary><p>Unlike other online RSA courses, our trainers mark continually throughout the day - not just once at the end. Also our RSA assessment is split-up nicely into topics, allowing you to move ahead at your own pace as we mark and provide feedback in parallel.</p><p>So if it's before 11:00 AM (Melbourne time) on a weekday, then yes it should be possible to get your RSA certificate today, but you had best get moving!</p><p>Generally though, it's better to plan ahead, take your time and aim for the next business day.</p><p>But if you do find yourself in rush, please let us know and we'll do our best to keep an eye out for your assessments and prioritise marking accordingly - there is no charge for this, we are happy to go above and beyond for our valued students!</p></details><details><summary>4. Are there any additional fees to pay?</summary><p>Absolutely not! There is no more to pay, than what you choose to pay up-front today. (see options below)</p><p>It seems obvious, but we are aware of unscrupulous providers appearing 'cheap' but charging hidden fees for;</p><ul><li>Basic support - like, seriously!</li><li>Re-marking if you answer incorrectly - nobody's perfect.</li><li>Issuing your certificate - start free now, trap you later!</li><li>Unnecessary & non-standard RSA cards - not accepted by employers.</li></ul><p>Warning: We are aware of at least 1 company advertising non-accredited 'introduction' RSA courses. (amongst others)
Please don't fall for these scam courses! Only RSA certificates issued by Australian Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) are valid and accepted by employers.
There is no need to do an introductory course, everything you need to know will be well-covered in our fully accredited RSA courses.</p></details><details><summary>5. Do you price-match competitors?</summary><p>In short, no, because the quality of our RSA courses and the time and effort our trainers put in, is far-far greater than <i>any competitor</i> - especially those undercutting our fair and ethical pricing.</p><p>How? Because we have <em>developed and streamlined</em> our systems <em>in-house</em> for over 15 years! If anyone is charging less than us, it is a given they are doing a LOT less for you and cutting major corners.</p><p>And what are we talking about here really, the price of 1 or 2 drinks out.. the 'cost' might be losing shifts, or a great job entirely, because of a silly mistake due to subpar training.</p><p>As a highly ethical business, we have invested back heavily into improving our course and systems. And we've been here the longest too - OnlineRSA.com.au (there can be only one - we are the original)</p><p>The quality of our courses has earned us <i>first class approvals from ALL States</i>, whereas cheaper foes will be missing one or more of VIC, NSW, TAS, SA or ACT - the reason being, is these States have more arduous (responsible) approval vetting, to weed out poor <em>self-assessed</em> providers. Simply put, those cheaper courses would not pass muster - so as a workaround, they will have you do a completely unrelated State course, then fob you off to a separate 'bridging course'. That's a big red flag right there! Not to mention a waste of your time and the additional hidden costs.</p><p>We understand times are tough and every dollar counts, but we honestly and ethically deliver maximum value for money and go above and beyond for our students! Their 'cheap' is just that, cheap.</p><p>And if you start our course and change your mind about getting an RSA (maybe the job offer falls though) you are covered by our 7 day, 100% money-back guarantee. Fair!</p></details><details><summary>6. What are the terms of your money-back guarantee?</summary><p>We are proud to offer a 100% money-back guarantee under fair and reasonable conditions;</p><ul><li>where the refund is requested within 7 days of purchase</li><li>and; you have not completed the course and qualified for your certificate.</li></ul><p>If the course is so good, then why would we need to offer a guarantee?</p><p>There are occasions where a person changes their mind about getting an RSA today. Maybe a job offer falls though or their only computer/internet connection explodes. In any case, we have you covered.</p></details></div></div></div></div><div class=container><div class="grid grid-2-col grid-align-center grid-bkwt grid-bkwt-2-rows"><div class=hidden></div><div class=hidden></div><div class=flex-center><div astyle=max-width:80%><h2>Ready to Go?</h2><div><p>It only takes minutes to enrol and get started - you could have your RSA and be ready for work tonight!</p><p><a class="button start-rsa" href=#shop>Get Started Now</a></p></div><div class=flex-center></div></div></div><div class="flex-center bg-cover rounded" data-bglazy-src=https://cdn.onlinersa.com.au/assets/cheers/helena-yankovska-7EbGkOm8pWM-unsplash--300.jpg></div></div><template id=demo-template type=text/template><div id=demo-nav class=flex-center><div><a class="button close" href=#>Close demo and return to Online RSA</a></div></div><div id=demo-wrapper astyle=background-color:limegreen><div class=demo-container astyle=background-color:red><div id=demo-ar astyle=background-color:aqua><iframe src=/rsa/media/promo/elp-rsa-promo-20220804/story.html title="RSA Demo" style=min-width:100%;min-height:100%></iframe></div></div></div></template></div></section><section class="p-t-section p-b-section"><div id=reviews2 class="container hero-reviews"><h2 class=text-color-dkgray>More &#x2764; From Our Students</h2><div class="grid grid-auto grid-align-start p-t-gap" data-balance-3=blockquote><div class="review review-feat"><blockquote>The SIMBAR was great and made me confident by being able to use the information I&rsquo;d learned. also the layout of information followed by a short assessment rather than an overload of information and a big test at the end
