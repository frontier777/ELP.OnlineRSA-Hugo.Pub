The billing information is separate from the student registration. When payment has been made, an email is sent out to
you with instructions on how to get started, along with your enrolment code. When you click on the enrolment code in that
email, it takes you to the student registration page. You will need to click on the Begin Registration button.</p><p>NOTE: when you click on the Begin Registration button, it is very important that you register the details of the person who
is to do the course. The billing information can be in anyoneâ€™s name, but the registration on the student site (after payment
has been made) must be in the name of the student completing the course.</p><h3 id=any_additional_fees>Are there any hidden or additional fees?</h3><p>The price you pay from this website is the only cost - there are no hidden charges.</p><p>We are aware of other less ethical providers charging for;</p><ul><li>reattempting assessments - if you don't pass on the first attempt they may charge to reset your account.</li><li>support calls - just because it's online training you should not be penalised for asking to speak with a trainer.</li><li>issuing a certificate - you may just be purchasing the 'training' not the certificate.</li><li>lodging with state liquor authorities - again purchasing national training, but missing the State certificate.</li><li>change of details - if you enter your name or other information incorrectly.</li><li>late fees - if you don't finish the course on time.</li><li>government fees - especially in NSW where this fee is $97 at time of writing</li></ul><p>We will never charge you for these kinds of things.
