      <description>Yes, with Online RSA it&amp;rsquo;s possible to start and finish your RSA course all on the same day!&#xA;We can honestly make this claim because of the unique way we assess you throughout the course and mark in the background as you continue to progress. So there is no big long assessment and wait for marking at the end, like all other providers we are aware of.&#xA;But to set your expectations, we generally only mark during business hours AEST, Monday to Friday.</description>

      <guid>https://onlinersa.com.au/rsa/FAQ/State-by-State-Requirements.html</guid>
      <description>Can I get one RSA training course that will cover the whole of Australia?&#xD;Yes, but..&#xD;Unfortunately some states and territories have differing requirements for RSA training, assessment and certificate/badge/competency cards.&#xD;Therefore it is not possible to do one single course that will satisfy all requirements for all states, but, you are able to bridge your&#xD;qualification to the other states.&#xD;Our recommendation is that you should choose the state where you are most likely to start working and complete that course, making sure to&#xD;click on all of the available state variations when you come to the map sections.</description>
