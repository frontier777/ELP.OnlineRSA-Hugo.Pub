      <title>Start and complete your Online RSA the Same-Day</title>
      <link>https://onlinersa.com.au/same_day_rsa_certificate/</link>

      <description>Yes, with Online RSA it&amp;rsquo;s possible to start and finish your RSA course all on the same day.&#xA;To set your expectations, we generally mark during business hours AEST, Monday to Friday. So realistically to complete all in one day you should be getting started before 12pm - unless you have prior RSA knowledge.&#xA;Most people complete by the next business day.&#xA;If you are in a hurry to work &amp;rsquo;tonight&amp;rsquo; though, please let our RSA trainer team know and we will keep an eye out for your assessments and do our best to prioritise marking them.</description>
