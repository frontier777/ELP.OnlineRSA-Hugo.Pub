Our price has only come down over the years as we have innovated technologically for longer and more intensely than any other Australian training organisation - technology is one of our core strengths!</p><ul><li>In 2007 RSA was $90 inflationary adjusted to 2023 = $137.60</li><li>In 2010 RSA was $75 inflationary adjusted to 2023 = $104.91</li><li>In 2012 RSA was $49 inflationary adjusted to 2023 = $65.20</li><li>In 2018 RSA was $39 inflationary adjusted to 2023 = $46.27</li></ul><p>In 2024 our RSA is still $39 and we all know $39 doesn&rsquo;t buy what it bought last year.</p><p>What the above table shows, is if we increased prices in line with our inflationary costs - like the supermarkets for example - we should be charging at least $46-65.</p><p>So we think <em><strong>$39 is quite fair!</strong></em></p><h2 id=but-so-and-so-down-the-road-are-charging-only-20-something-for-theirs-what-gives>But so-and-so down the road are charging only $20-something for theirs, what gives?</h2><p>Yes, we are well-aware that some of our <em><strong>quote-unquote &ldquo;competitors&rdquo;</strong></em> are selling their RSA courses at <em><strong>unsustainably low prices</strong></em>.</p><p>What they don&rsquo;t tell you about, are the corners they are cutting to achieve those crazy bargain prices. So let&rsquo;s explore that next.</p><h2 id=let-us-break-that-down-for-you>Let us break that down for you..</h2><p>Consider it costs on average about $15-20 to advertise and sell a single RSA course through Google Ads - that money is now in Google&rsquo;s pocket.</p><p>So what is left (after ~2% payment processing fees) of that $25 (or less) cheap RSA course, is about $5 to cover all business and trainer costs associated with your enrolment.</p><p>Properly qualified trainers with 3+ years industry experience plus a Cert IV training and assessing qualification, start around $60/hour ($1/minute) when paid an ethical livable wage - this includes all standard Australian benefits like holidays, personal leave and superannuation.</p><p>So that $5 buys a whole 5 minutes worth of attention towards you!</p><p>As I am sure you can appreciate, it&rsquo;s IMPOSSIBLE to do a proper RSA assessment to the standards set out in the <a href=https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/SITHFAB021>SITHFAB021 unit of competency</a> in just 5 minutes!</p><p>Let alone if you need to spend some time supporting and training any students.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s not to menition the major annual charges that need to be amortsised accross total sales.</p><ul><li>rto licencing fees $2,000/year</li><li>rto compliance costs $10,000/year</li><li>rto insurance costs $1,000/year</li><li>course reviews and updates $5,000/year</li><li>server hosting costs $6,000/year</li><li>learning management system costs $10,000/year</li><li>miscellaneous business/office costs $5,000/year</li><li>rental of a physical office space $20,000/year</li></ul><p>There are also the upfront startup costs for a registered training organisation.</p><ul><li>rto business esablishment costs $20000+</li><li>initial course authoring costs $50000+</li></ul><h2 id=so-how-do-they-manage-to-stay-in-business-then>So how do they manage to stay in business then?</h2><p>In a nutshell, <em><strong>blatant cheating</strong></em> and <em><strong>&lsquo;working&rsquo; the system!</strong></em></p><ul><li>Their courses simply consist of plain boring walls of text and still stock images. What video content they include is essentially very dated stock footage hastily prepared by government bodies at the time.</li><li>Their assessments are an absolute joke, not fit for purpose at all! Student guessing & cheating is possible and goes unchecked. The dirty little secret is RTO&rsquo;s can somewhat self-assess their own performance and the training regulator is too busy to audit them. It&rsquo;s no wonder most get shut down when finally audited.</li><li>They use dirt-cheap overseas <em>&ldquo;support operators&rdquo;</em> instead of qualified local trainers. This is in serious violation of their RTO accreditation, but again hard to detect by the regulator.</li><li>They may be claiming monies on other government training programs - there aren&rsquo;t any for a short couse like Responsible Service of Alcohol, so..</li><li>Rich backers believe that crashing the market price it will eventually leave only them in business. At that point they will be able to increase prices and recoup earlier losses as a self-crowned monopoly.</li><li>It&rsquo;s rare, but some (eg. fastcourses) are outright scammers selling non-accredited &lsquo;introductory&rsquo; courses. By law these certificates cannot be accepted by Australian employer, so are just a total scam and waste of money, catching out unsuspecting people.</li></ul><h2 id=in-summary-and-an-important-case-study>In summary and an important case study</h2><p><em><strong>This kind of wilful neglect is totally unethical</strong></em> and has the potential to damage the whole hospitality industry - it&rsquo;s not theoretical, it&rsquo;s already happened once before..</p><p>In 2012 NSW, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Thomas_Kelly>Thomas Kelly</a> was tragically killed by a coward punch. This incident was initially blamed on poor training - that was rampant at the time. As it turns out, it wasn&rsquo;t and staff acted appropriately in the situation, but, the stigma stuck around and the NSW government ordered a ceasement of all online RSA training for a number of years. And the subsequent reforms to the licensed venues in the area arguably led to the destruction of the nightlife culture in the Sydney city district. Those reforms are only now starting to be repealed, more than a decade later!</p><p>As this case demonstrates, a single RSA-related incident has the potential to bring an entire industry to it&rsquo;s knees. We as RTO&rsquo;s have a duty of care to uphold the standards of the unit of competency and to not be sending out unqualified students into the workforce - just to save a buck! Anything less is unfair to the industry as a whole.</p><h2 id=a-key-take-away>A key take-away</h2><p>When you&rsquo;re working in licensed venues, you are counting on your team mates to <em><strong>have your back</strong></em>. Ask yourself, how would you feel to discover they were objectively unqualified for that position?!</p><h2 id=thank-you-for-your-understanding-heres-what-we-can-offer>Thank you for your understanding, here&rsquo;s what we can offer</h2><p>We are passionate about RSA and would rather take a small loss of profit on a limited number of sales/day, than to have those in genuine financial hardship receive subpar RSA training.</p><p>So we are <strong>excited to trial a new self-discounting system.</strong></p><p>If you feel you are <em><strong>genuinely in need</strong></em> of saving $5 or $10 off the cost of your RSA course <em><strong>today</strong></em>, then simply complete the form below and we will immediately email you a coupon to use at the checkout.</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> We are relying on the honesty of our customers.
